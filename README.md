# ML_models_and_practices
This repository documents my practice projects and computational models created during my studies in machine learning. The exercises are based on course materials from the University of Toronto, covering topics such as kNN, linear regression, logistic regression, neural network and so on.

Each model includes code (numpy, Python), simulations, and analysis to reinforce theoretical concepts. This serves as both a learning archive and a reference for future projects.

Course-Inspired: Exercises derived from UofT's ML curriculum (CSC311).
